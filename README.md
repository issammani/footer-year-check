# footer-year-check

A crawler that crawls (no surprise there) websites and checks wether the copyright year is up-to-date or not. #OCD


## Installation

```sh
npm i footer-year-check
```

## Usage example
The script doesn't do much aside from fetching, parsing and writing to files.
First you need to get a crawler instance:

```js
const {crawler} = require('footer-year-check');
```

If this is the first time the script is run, it will use the urls from `cache/cached-queue-example.json`. On subsequent runs it will use the most recent cache it generates.

```js
const {crawler} = require('footer-year-check');
crawler.run(); // Will use the urls from `cache/cached-queue-example.json` if this is the first run
```

To add your own urls to the carwler queue you can call `addUrls` method:

```js
const {crawler} = require('footer-year-check');
crawler.addUrls(['https://foo.bar', 'https://bar.baz', 'https://baz.foo']);
crawler.run();
```

> **NB1:** To stop the program you can just hit CTRL-C and the script will save the progress to disk. Otherwise you can use `timeout` to automate the process: 
```sh
timeout --signal=SIGINT 1h npm start # Run for one hour
```

> **NB2:** The results will be stored inside the store dir.
